This project builds and evaluates a deep learning model to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The goal is to accurately classify images as either **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**.

---

## 🩺 Project Objective

To develop a binary image classification model that distinguishes between:
- **NORMAL** lungs
- **Lungs infected with PNEUMONIA**

We leverage **TensorFlow/Keras** and techniques like **data augmentation**, **class weighting**, and **hyperparameter tuning** using **Optuna** and **MLflow** for experiment tracking.

---

## 📁 Dataset

We use the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) provided by Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Input layer (Rescaled to 224x224 or 128x128)
- Convolutional layers with ReLU
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Batch Normalization
- Fully Connected Dense layers
- Output layer (Sigmoid for binary classification)

## ⚙️ Features

- 🏷️ **Binary Classification** (NORMAL vs PNEUMONIA)
- ⚖️ **Class Balancing** using:
  - Class Weights
  - Data Augmentation (only on NORMAL class to handle imbalance)
- 📈 **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- 🔍 **Confusion Matrix** and classification report
- 🧪 **Hyperparameter Tuning** with [Optuna](https://optuna.org/)
- 📊 **Experiment Tracking** with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Prepare dataset

Download the dataset and place it in the `dataset/` folder with proper train/val/test split.

## 📊 Sample Output

**Confusion Matrix**

|               | Predicted NORMAL | Predicted PNEUMONIA |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Actual NORMAL |       167        |          8           |
| Actual PNEUMONIA |     54        |         486          |

**Classification Report**
```
               precision    recall  f1-score   support
